# Sorting-algorithms-in-JAVA
Implemented a sorting algorithms(Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort, Merge sort, Quick sort) in java 

Bubble Sort:
A simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 

Insertion Sort:
Builds a sorted array one element at a time, inserting each element into its correct position within the sorted portion. 
Selection Sort:
Finds the minimum element, swaps it with the first element, then repeats for the remaining unsorted portion. 

Merge Sort:
A divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the list into sublists, sorts them, and then merges them back together. 

Quick Sort:
Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the list around it.
